        <p>
          Any team member can make proposals for decisions to be made. Since there are topics
          that each person is unfamiliar with, the proposer should first have done at least a
          small amount of research for why they wish to implement a feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once there is a basic proposal, it is presented to everyone, and everyone puts forward
          ideas on how to implement a feature(e.g. how to deal with missing date metadata in
          photos; how to write forms quickly with validation).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the whole team has had a chance to contribute, we set a quality benchmark, which
          is “is this approach suitable for a Minimum Viable Product?”. Once everyone agrees
          that this benchmark is met, the task is broken down into tasks in different domains
          (frontend, backend, testing/devops) and the domain leads distribute this among team
          members. Sometimes tasks are split widely, other times the task requires an extremely
          high level of detailed coordination, in which case tasks are split among fewer people
          - with progress being reported to the rest of the team during meetings/stand-ups so
          that everyone is aware of the progress. This is also done with feedback from the
          assignees of the tasks, so that everyone feels comfortable with approaching the task
          they are given.
        </p>
        <p>
          If anyone finds their task too hard, they can ask others for help or return it to the
          backlog - we prioritise tasks to achieve a ‘steel thread’ - meeting baseline
          objectives/features/requirements first to quickly allow us to add in the smaller
          details later.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are conflicts, which are rare, the project manager is to be notified and can
          make a final call that fulfils every team member’s needs and interests. This may
          involve reducing the priority of a feature/requirement (and contacting the client to
          make sure they are well aware); simply pushing the feature back for later; scaling
          back the scope of the requirements (i.e. invent and simplify), or working with
          teammates to simplify the implementation (which can also improve our architecture and
          code quality, readability, and design).
        </p>
        <h3 id='TeamDecisionMaking-TaskSplittingDecisions'>Task Splitting Decisions</h3>
        <p>
          Team leads will make decisions for splitting tasks evenly in that area (e.g. the
          front-end lead splits front-end tasks for each individual). As mentioned above, if
          anyone finds their task too hard, they can ask others for help or return it to the
          backlog - we prioritise tasks to achieve a ‘steel thread’ - meeting baseline
          objectives/features/requirements first to quickly allow us to add in the smaller
          details later.
        </p>
        <h3 id='TeamDecisionMaking-Stack/frameworkdecisions'>Stack/framework decisions</h3>
        <p>
          Any proposer can put forward stack/framework/library suggestions, and these must go
          through the decision process above. This is because we want to
          <strong>minimise dependencies and bloat</strong> whilst also making sure we choose
          dependencies <strong>that let us focus on business logic and reliability.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2 id='TeamDecisionMaking-Examples'>Examples</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Next.js - opinionated React + faster to set up than Create-React-App</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <code>react-hook-form</code> with <code>zod</code> - Lets us write complex forms
              quickly with validation and type-safety, allows us to add features that inspect
              form state such as a loading indicator for when it is in progress.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              tRPC - write new APIs in only a few lines of code, abstract away JSON.stringify
              and JSON.parse so that we don’t have to deal with that.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Using the memory date for the sorting of photos because some photos in a memory
              may not have the EXIF date (e.g. since they were downloaded from a chat app or
              because the data was intentionally cleared). This simplifies our handling of dates
              in our database and the sorting process.
