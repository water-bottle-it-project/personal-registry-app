                  provides facilities for organising photos into ‘Memories’, providing
                  chronological and spatial context, and ‘Collections’, providing content
                  context
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>needs to be easy to review the stored photos and find a specific one</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Functional requirements:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Need to be able to post photos grouped into a memory, with ability to tag by
                  date, location and content. This is more focused on reminiscing and
                  remembering memories
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Memories however shouldn’t rely solely on photos, and can exist just as a
                  title and/or description
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Collections allow photos across memories to be grouped/tagged. This is more
                  focused on finding specific photos or types of photos, regardless of their
                  respective memories
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Being easy to edit is key, from the Memories (title, description, photos
                  contained) to the collections and to the user’s Profile itself
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Search is also important, especially when you don’t know specifically what
                  you’re searching for. This means the user needs to be able to use whatever
                  information they <em>do</em> have to find what they want - captions, date,
                  etc.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  And of course, being a photo storage app the user should be able to easily
                  view their photos in full detail, alongside important metadata that might be
                  useful, and should be able to download photos are they please.

                  We used the Mantine UI library to easily create a cohesive and pleasant UI.
                  Everything from font sizes to text colors is standardized across the
                  registry<br /><br /><strong>Responsive Design</strong>

              <li>
                <p>
                  When designing the frontend, we’ve made sure to keep responsive design in
                  mind. With this approach, we reduced the risk of having to change a certain
                  component after the fact.

                  high-level UI was done using Figma. This was chosen because of its excellent
                  collaboration abilities as well as it’s easy integration with Mantine UI
                  library components, giving us a very accurate representation of our site would
                  appear with minimal effort. This made it easy to convey our design decisions
                  to the client without having to build it all first, and meant major design
                  decisions could be made early, before implementation
                </p>

                  low-level UI was done using Excalidraw. It also allows for easy collaboration,
                  but also doesn’t mess around with unimportant (at this level) decisions such
                  as colours and fonts - instead it allows for quick and dirty prototyping to
                  sketch the vague concepts, which can be agreed upon at this level, before
                  being fleshed out in high-level design.

                  Location Integration was achieved by using

                    class='external-link'
                    href='https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/'

              <li>
                <p>
                  Location features implemented in our app are:<br />1. Displaying an
                  interactive map and a marker based on location data (stored as a string) of an
                  image<br />2. String-based location search in the interactive map for creating
                  and editing a memory.<br />
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  These features were implemented using two concepts:<br /><br /><strong
                >Forward Geocoding</strong
                ><br />Converts location text into geographic coordinates. It enables us to
                  accurately place a marker on the map.<br /><br /><strong
                >Reverse Geocoding</strong
                ><br />Converts geographic coordinates into location text (strings). This
                  allows us to store and display meaningful location data represented by text.
                  In our app, this text also allows us to search for the location of a photo and
                  place the marker on the map for display in the metadata section of a photo.
                </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              Because it is difficult to organise meetings given the busy the schedules of 5
              people, the team made use of asynchronous communication in the form of Slack
              messaging and Github Comments, to still allow for conversations to occur and
              progress to be made.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  This also provides the benefit of documenting conversation and solutions to
                  questions asked for future reference, as well as keeping all team members in
                  the loop
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Slack also has excellent Jira and Github integration, providing bots that
                  notify the team of deployment, pushes to main, pull requests, Jira ticket
                  updates and changes to our Confluence documentation. This kept us up-to-date
                  without having to log in constantly and potentially missing an important
                  update
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The team also met (outside of workshop) at least once over Zoom, in order to
              review the weeks work and plan ahead, as well as to ask questions. This allowed
              for quicker conversation of important topics, as well as demonstrations of certain
              technologies.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  For reference, all Zoom meetings were documented (content covered, plans for
                  future, actionable items etc.) in the team Confluence
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The team Confluence was used for documentation, so that the team members can
              communicate their changes and design decisions for easy reference
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since our client preferred asynchronous communication, we also supplemented Zoom
              meetings with documents that provide updates outlining our progress.
