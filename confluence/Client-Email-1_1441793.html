        <p>Good evening Yunan</p>
        <p>
          My name is Jack, and I’m contacting you on behalf of Team 055 for the IT Project!
          We’re looking forward to working with you this semester! We wanted to meet with you
          and get started, and were looking to sort out some of the initial details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, we were wondering what your best method of contact is - we have your email,
          but want to know if you’d like to join our Slack and/or Jira, which we’re using for
          communication and project management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we would love to set up a meeting and get started - if you could let us know
          your availabilities we can work with you to find a time. We’re also happy to meet in
          person or online (over Zoom for example), so whichever one works best for you we’re
          happy to accommodate. We hope to meet you on Friday or early next week.
        </p>
        <p />
        <p>Let us know what you think, looking forward to getting started!</p>
        <p>Many thanks,</p>
        <p>Jack, Sean, Calvin, Kian, Ian</p>
