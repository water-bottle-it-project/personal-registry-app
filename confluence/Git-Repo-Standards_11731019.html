          We’ve split up tasks. Now how do we use <code>git</code> effectively to make sure that
          tasks can come together cohesively, still build successfully, while keeping the
          repository clean? <code>git</code> provides many ways to work on code distributively,
          but we need to follow a standard to ensure fast delivery.

        <h2 id='GitRepoStandards-CommitMessages'>Commit Messages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Informative, brief, and clearly describes the feature or small tweak being
              changed, added, or removed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If a commit comprises only of small tweak to an old previously-worked-on feature,
              there is no need to make a new issue on the board, since this introduces too much
              overhead and is a barrier to moving fast.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If a large feature branch, try to include the issue label on every commit. If this
              is not possible, at least add it on the last commit to the feature branch so that
              when squash-merging or rebase-merging, there is a marker to track where the
              commits for this feature are at.
            </p>

            <p>
              We follow philosophy of continuous integration and deployment, which means making
              <strong>small feature branches</strong> and rebase-merging or squash-merging small
              working commits into main <strong>as frequently as possible. </strong>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We do this to ensure that the code base is continuously evolving to fulfil the
              requirements and features planned out, and to make sure that we don’t have to deal
              with the pain of merging in a big feature branch/pull request that has not kept up
              to date with main for a while.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The biggest kinds of pain points occur when changing prop types of components
                  or request/response types to the backend API as a result of changing
                  requirements or simplifying the implementation of a feature

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              This requires team members to hone their skills in breaking up tasks into smaller,
              digestible, and most importantly, successfully-buildable chunks/commits.

              Linear commit history makes using <code>git blame</code> and
              <code>git bisect</code> easier when debugging when a regression in the quality of
              a feature occurred. For example, this was useful in debugging a grid causing the
              view to have an additional 80px to the right in

              The merge commit, which is added after adding all the commits from the feature
              branch, bloats the branch <strong>and hides important diffs </strong>which are
              needed to have at a glance look at code changes

              Ensures API stability - do not change response types unless there is a business
              need or implementing a new requirement

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Blind use of merge and ignoring conflicts ends up causing a cobweb on linked
              commits that are impossible to merge into main correctly when there are multiple
              people working on different tasks at the same time.
