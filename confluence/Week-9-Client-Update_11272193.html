                    <p>The purpose of this page is to provide the client with an update as to how our project has progressed since the last client communication on the 11th of September. Based the updates on the commits to the repo and important things I remembered from standups but please expand. The client has expressed a preference towards written Slack messages over Zoom meetings.</p><p /><p>Hi Yunan,</p><p>Attached is a brief overview of the progress we’ve made since our last meeting (11th of September). Since we don’t have any pressing questions that require your immediate feedback and you’ve expressed a preference towards written messages over Zoom meeting, we’ve decided to give you this text rundown in lieu of a Zoom meeting. </p><p>As a team, we’ve made steady and satisfactory progress through the remainder of Sprint 2, having achieved our goals for the sprint. We’ve received good feedback from our tutor, and have the vast majority of the ‘must-haves’ implemented in some form, and are rapidly approaching our minimum viable product. </p><p>The highlights include:</p><ul><li><p>Collections are now implemented, with functionality for creating, viewing, editing and deleting a Collection</p><ul><li><p>Memory detail editing is also implemented, and you can now add and remove collections while editing a Memory. </p></li><li><p>Memories also have a Grid View now, making it easier to view your photos from a memory with less scrolling. </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Search is the next major feature to finish, although significant progress has already been made and it is functional for some pages.</p></li><li><p>Significant behind the scenes progress has been made, particularly in regards to refactoring the Memories code, as well as efforts to make sure our pages look better under a variety of screen sizes, including on mobile. </p></li><li><p>Account management progress is also continuing to be made, with the functionality for deleting an existing account and all associated data nearing completion</p></li><li><p>Caching was implemented, reducing subsequent load times for images after their first viewing and overall query usage</p></li><li><p>As we being to finish implementation, we’re starting to focus on testing. We are currently building a set of manual test cases to ensure functionality of all components, and foundations for Github Actions were recently setup.</p></li></ul><p /><p>We’re happy with our progress and excited to show you our finished results. This is a link to a live demo deployment if you’d like to explore our current product: <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://personal-registry-app-zx936.ondigitalocean.app" rel="nofollow">https://personal-registry-app-zx936.ondigitalocean.app</a> </p><p>We’ve populated a test account for you to use; the username is <strong>1u@mailinator.com</strong> and the password <strong>123456</strong></p><p /><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns, we’ll likely be in touch sometime soon to organise our next Zoom meeting!</p><p /><p />
